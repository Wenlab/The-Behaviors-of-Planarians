# About the planarian

* the function of the brain of the planarian ([reference](F:\1_learning\research\planarian\reference))
  * sensory: essential
    * It has been shown that the headless part is unable to taxis to food (2015, Inoue), taxis to low temperature (2014, Inoue)。
  * motor: **not essential**
    * The headless piece moves at about the same speed as an intact planarian (2014, Inoue)
  * learning and memory: **unclear**
    * [1950-1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planarian#As_a_model_system_in_biological_and_biomedical_research)
      * Planarians can eat food when there is light.
      * They can memorize that.
      * This memory can be transferred by being eaten
    * (2015, Inoue) reproduced that planarians can eat food when there is light (400 lux, equals to office light), but did not reproduce further. I think that either the significance is not high, or the experiment is too difficult (there are too many variables to control, so a highly skilled experimenter is needed).
      * I can send an email to Inoue to ask if he had reproduced the memory exp.
  * sleep: **yes (for the flatworm)**
* molecular technique on the planarian
  * can't do anything to the DNA
  * only can affect the RNA
    * use double strand RNA to do RNAi




# About their lab

目标：研究再生。

模式生物：涡虫、青蛙、蝾螈、娃娃鱼、小鼠。

人员背景：多数做实验，少数做生信。

bad news

* 曾和裴是邻居。裴是曾的老师的老师。
* 曾对发论文的追求>对科学的追求。
* 曾对学生太过push+曾对学生人身攻击。



# Next Step

* 第一步：证明涡虫可以学习、记忆
  * 机械刺激+习惯化
    * pass
  * 趋温
    * pass
  * 电刺激+习惯化
    * pass
  * **空间记忆**
  * **联合学习（如果那篇文章没有问题，那么联合学习从易到难为：中性化学物质>光>温度）**
    * 中性化学物质+食物
    * 中性化学物质+电刺激。
    * 光+食物
    * 光+电刺激
    * 温度+食物
    * 温度+电刺激
* 第二步：涡虫被切成两段后，这两段都保留了原来的记忆吗？
  * **切开+再生**
  * **切开+换头**
